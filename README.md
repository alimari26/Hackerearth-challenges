These are problems (challanges) taken from the website Hackerearth.com, under the tab practice. 
These are all interview question created for practice.
I take no credit for the question, but the solutions are 100% mine. 
Also, if a distinquisable algorithm is found, it will be noted as commenent for futher use.
Hope you will find this useful.
